# Obsidian Non-Graph Links

Plugin that allows you to create internal links in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) without creating graph edges.

## How to use

Put any link or the name of any page into double curly brackets, like so: ``{{Test Page}}``. Like normal Obsidian internal links, it can also have an alias: ``{{Test Page|Test Alias}}``.

## Todo

- [ ] update ngls when filename is updated
- [ ] show selection dialog showing file names when typing link
- [ ] remove underline when caret is over link

## Why?

Often links need to be made for convenience but would clutter the graph structure.
